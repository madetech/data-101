## Overview

Data analytics and data engineering are two closely related fields that both deal with data, but have different roles and responsibilities.

Data Analysts focus on interpreting and visualizing data, while Data Engineers design and maintain data infrastructure.  

## What does a data analyst do?

A data analyst works with data to derive useful insights from it at which point it could be referred to as information. Often, data analysts want to answer specific questions based on the requirements of decision-makers or stakeholders.

Data analysis involves a series of steps, starting with collecting or querying the data from various sources such as databases, spreadsheets and files like CSV, Parquet etc. The type of data analysts work with is usally structured data as opposed to unstructured or semi structured data. Sometimes the data will require some ["wrangling"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling) which can entail removing duplicates, fixing formatting and generally ensuring its usability.
The subsequent stage involves analysing the data using various statistical methods and interpreting the results of this process. Once useful results have been obtained, analysts can present and share this data with those who require it using varous data visualisation tools. Data analysts might have a background in statistics, mathematics, computer science, economics or a similar field. They have good numeracy and problem-solving skills and often work with people from other professions.

Data analysts have an additional important function, they must translate their findings to non-technical stakeholders inside and outside the organization. Data is only useful if it can be understood.

## What does a data engineer do?

Data engineers are responsible for the infrastructure that handles and moves data. They are responsible for creating and maintaining the architecture (databases and data processing systems), pipelines, and data sets that data analysts and data scientists use in their work.
 These professionals are typically skilled in data storage solutions such as on premises data warehouses and modern cloud first solutions like data lakes and data lakehouses. Regardless of the underlying technology data engineers ensure data is clean, reliable, accessible to those that need it.

They often have a background in computer science or related fields. They may also create automated processes, find ways of optimising data delivery, redesign existing infrastructure, build analytics tools and develop performance metrics. The job of a data engineer often involves working closely with others, including data analysts and data scientists, product design teams, statisticians, executives and developers.


## Main differences between the two

### Data handling
These two professions interact with data in different ways. A helpful way of understanding this is by considering the data pipeline. The pipeline enables raw data to go from a source to a sink or other storage solution. Along the way, data engineers ensure that the data is in a usable format. Once it reaches the end of this pipeline, it passes from the data engineer to the data analyst. The analyst can extract or otherwise collect this data based on the questions they want to answer. The data can then go through the data analysis process.
The format of the data also differs between the two roles. A data engineer typically handles the raw data that an app, website or computer program might collect. Conversely, clean, visualised data is the responsibility of a data analyst.

## Does either of these roles use Machine Learning (ML)?
Yes, data engineers may use ML in their work. ML is a form of Artificial Inteligence (AI) that can learn from its experiences, making it more effective over time. This can be useful in the frameworks for data architecture and automation, making it easier to collect data efficiently without human intervention. Knowledge of ML is typically unnecessary for a data analyst, although data scientists may find it more relevant to their work.

## Transition from analyst to engineer
If you are interested in transitioning from a data analytics background to a data engineering role, you already possess a foundational understanding of data, its importance, and how to interpret it. However, data engineering requires a deeper dive into the technical aspects of data handling, storage, and processing. Start with [data-101 training resources](../data_learning_paths/data_101.md).

Some additional resources to consider:

### Foundational Courses in Computer Science and Programming:

Concepts such as algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented programming are fundamental. If you donâ€™t have a computer science background, consider taking introductory courses in these areas.

### Database Management and SQL:

While you may already be familiar with SQL from your analytics background, a richer understanding will be beneficial. Look into courses or workshops that delve into advanced SQL topics, database architecture, and both relational and NoSQL databases.

### Big Data Technologies:

Learn about distributed data storage and processing frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, and Kafka. Platforms like Databricks offer certifications and training in these technologies.

### Cloud Platforms:

Familiarize yourself with major cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, particularly their data-related services. Cloud providers often offer training and certifications, which can be immensely beneficial.

### ETL Tools and Processes:

Having hands-on experience with ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and tools will be crucial. See also [tooling](tooling.md)

### Certifications:

See [certifications](../data_learning_paths/certs.md).
