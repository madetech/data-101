# data-101: An introduction to big data in Made Tech

Welcome to the data-101 learning pack! Here you can find a clear learning path to guide you on your way into the world of data engineering.
We're also building a collection of supplementary learning modules, these are not strictly necessary but highly relevant to data engineering.
You can find the core learning path below, this is a series of concise modules aiming to take an engineer with no data experience to feeling competent when presented with a data focussed project.
